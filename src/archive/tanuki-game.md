    challenge: 
        Getting Tanuki to go around the screen without going completely off the viewport.
    solution:
        Got two variables to capture the screen's width and height when the function is called, and based my Math.random function with the results of the screen size in mind.

## Summary

This was the first **JavaScript** game that I made. Although it is very simple, I will always hold this game dearly because I have learned a lot of core JavaScript concepts thanks to it. The original idea was based off of duck hunt, a game where you have to click on a flying duck, but modified it to include a timer as well as removed the murder aspects of it. There are 3 difficulties which determine how fast Tanuki the dog moves, how many points you need to win, and also how much time you have left.

## Development

I developed this game as my first real JavaScript project. I had a lot of fun building this project, and I plan to remake it with the skills I have gained since I originally made it back in July of 2022. For the development process, I tried to make use of most of the JavaScript skills I've learned as opposed to making the bare minimum game.

For the time I wrote it, there are a couple lines of code that I'm impressed to have known, such as the set time out to show and hide the bubbles when you click on Tanuki.

I remember the hardest part when making this was finding out what the user's screen was to make sure Tanuki doesn't create a horizontal scroll bar from going completely off screen.

## Styling

I did not focus too much on styling, as it was mostly a game to test out JavaScript features, but that being said I drew out Tanuki based on the memory of a dog drawing I saw on Instagram. The images, such as the background, and the music I took from royalty free websites such as pixabay and unsplash. The modal, buttons and UI of the game I styled myself with CSS.
