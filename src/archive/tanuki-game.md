    challenge: 
        The challenge of this project was displaying and filtering all projects and displaying them onto one dynamic page as opposed to making a separate page for each project.
    solution:
        The solution for this was made very simple thanks to astro's way of exporting and importing .md/.mdx files. After importing all the information from the .md files, I was able to filter out specific projects or blog posts using the markdown's front matter tags.
