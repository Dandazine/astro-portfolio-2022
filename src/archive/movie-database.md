    challenge: 
        The challenge of this project was learning how to collaborate properly and effeciently in a group while working with a language we were not familiar with.
    solution:
        We spent quote a bit of time communicating and planning out our roles and tasks for this project. We split the group up to 2 developers and 2 designers with occasional overlap inbetween.

## Summary

Nomi is a collaborative movie database project that was created in **NextJs**- a React Framework. It was made in order to display all featured movies from TheMovieDataBase, using their own **TMDB API**. With Nomi you can use the authentication system, which we made using **NextAuth**, to sign in with either Github or Google. When signed in, you can also favourite your selection of movies, and access them from the favourites page. We also developed a search function, which sends a separate API call, and displays search results based on user input in the search field if there are any matching movies on the database.

Our styling was done with **Sass**, a CSS extension, and **Material UI**.

## Development

As one of the two Developers, I worked on the functionality of the site, and helped clean up non-semantic code. My biggest contribution to the website was making sure the search function works and the website can return the correct results when a user inputs their search into the search field. I also helped link the movie to its respective page using NextJs's Link feature.

## Styling

For styling, I contributed to the group by fixing small styling errors or CSS issues if the design team had any issues.
